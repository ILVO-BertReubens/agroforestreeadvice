## Getting started
AgroforesTreeAdvice is an aggregator of tree selection tools. Existing tools were broken down into 2 parts: 
1) the database of tree characteristics 
2) the model that allows computing each tree species's score according to the input of the user (description of their site and description of their objectives) and the tree database

AgroforesTreeAdvice can be used either interactively through the shiny app user interface or by querying a model through an URL query.
The UI allows selecting the desired language, the desired tool, enter the user's site and objectives descriptions (according to the info needed by the specific tool), and then visualise the results
The URL query can be used to query one model with a set of parameters, and returns a tab-delimited file of the fresult

Contributors can:
1) Check/correct translations of each tool in their native language
2) Add a new model
3) Contribute to code
